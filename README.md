The goal of this project is to gain insights in predicting the extent of refugees that originate from countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

We are using data provided by the UNHCR, The UN Refugee Agency, and the World Bank. There is an R package available for this data using the following code:
devtools::install_github("unhcr/unhcrdatapackage")

The predictor variables we explore are related to the economy, natural disaster events(using EM-DAT, Int. Disaster Database), and government (using the V-Dem database).
